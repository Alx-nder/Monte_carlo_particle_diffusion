Start with 10,000 particles all located at x=0 at time t=0. Implement the Monte Carlo 
“random walk” in one-dimensions to mimic the diffusion of these particles. Thus, after every “unit 
time step”, simply move each particle 0.1 units to the right (with probability 0.5) or 0.1 units to the 
left (with probability 0.5). 
Plot a histogram of the particle distribution after: (a) 50 time steps, and (b) 500 time steps
